## 🚀 Getting Started (For Local Development)

1. **Clone the repo**

bash
git clone https://github.com/zaidshaikh-1/Prodigi_WD_05.git
cd Prodigi_WD_05

2. Add your API key

Create a file named config.js

Add the following:

const apiKey = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY";

config.js is ignored from Git, so your API key stays private.

3. Open index.html in a browser
